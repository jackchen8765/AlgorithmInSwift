 Maximum Product Cutting Problem
 
 Objective: Given a rope of length n meters, write an algorithm to cut the rope in such a way that product of different lengths of rope is maximum. At least one cut has to be made.
 
 Note: Assume that the length of rope is more than 2 meters, since at least one cut has to be made.
